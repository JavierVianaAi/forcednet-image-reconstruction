# Explainnet for image reconstruction

We demonstrate a simple Explainnet case for image reconstruction using as explanation the composite image of the saliency map that is intended to mimic the human eye focusing.

Download the flowers_dataset.zip which contains 1,000 images, unzip and place all the pictures in the data path as defined in the code.

Download the folder with the trained models of DeepGaze II and the centerbias reference data from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kYUwoatqQUS5EabeeSDc6gRmCysnVZ6N/view

Store the folder with all the files in the same path as the jupyter notebooks and name as: tools_deep_gaze
