# ForcedNet for image reconstruction

We demonstrate a simple ForcedNet case for image reconstruction using as explanation the composite image of the saliency map that is intended to mimic the human eye focusing.

Download the flowers_dataset.zip which contains 1,000 images, unzip and place all the pictures in the data path as defined in the code.
